# Binary Frequency Shift Keying

This is a proof-of-concept program that converts binary data to a BFSK signal.

## Dependencies

You will need to install **SOX** if you want to ear the generated signal (since
it is in raw format and not in a common format such as WAV) or import the
signal in **Audacity** as RAW with the correct parameters.
